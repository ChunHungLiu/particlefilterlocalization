particlefilterlocalization
==========================

Particle filter + 3D sensor = Localization

We use particle filter, OpenNI camera (XtionPro Live) and Android orientation sensor
altogether to implement 3D localization. 3D map is pregenerated by a scanning software.
We are still working on it.
